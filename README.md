# Neural_Networks
This project is about the creation and development of nerual networks from scratch

### Perceptron.py
This file is a single perceptron that learns and optimizes.
This perceptron is used for classification.

> [!TIP]
> how it works ?! this perceptron has a activation function and has a optimizer function if see any erro from output of activation function and real data send this data to optimaizer function and get new Wight from it and use from this for new calculate 

### Perceptron_liner_regression.py
This file is a single perceptron that learns and optimizes.
This perceptron is used for liner regression.

### Adaline.py
this file is a single neuron from adaline model and algorithms.

### LSTM.py
this file is a single neuron from LSTM model and algorithms.

### CNN.py
this file is a single neuron from Convolutional neural network model and algorithms.
