# Neural_Networks
This project is about the creation and development of nerual networks from scratch

### Perceptron.py
This file is a single perceptron that learns and optimizes.
This perceptron is used for classification and we will create another perceptron file and model for regression.
 
### Adaline.py
this file is a single neuron from adaline model and algorithms.

### LSTM.py
this file is a single neuron from LSTM model and algorithms.

### CNN.py
this file is a single neuron from Convolutional neural network model and algorithms.
