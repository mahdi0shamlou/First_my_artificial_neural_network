# Neural_Networks
This project is about the creation and development of nerual networks from scratch

### Perceptron.py
This file is a single perceptron that learns and optimizes.
This perceptron is used for classification.

> [!TIP]
> how it works ?! this perceptron has a activation function and has a optimizer function if see any difrent between output of activation function and real data send this data to optimaizer function and get new Wight from it and use from this for new calculate 

### Perceptron_liner_regression.py
This file is a single perceptron that learns and optimizes.
This perceptron is used for liner regression.

> [!TIP]
> how it works ?! this perceptron has a activation function(actuly it is just return of the input and do noting) and has a optimizer function if see any difrent between output of activation function and real data send this data to optimaizer function and get new Wight from it and use from this for new calculate this algorithm has small difreent from classification algorithms and this difrents in activation function and optimizer 

> [!CAUTION]
> in this file you should know in create wight method we need bios and we create a w in W vector Additional that becuase we need bios and in show line we consider that W for bios if you wnat use it just change it 

### Adaline.py
this file is a single neuron from adaline model and algorithms.

### LSTM.py
this file is a single neuron from LSTM model and algorithms.

### CNN.py
this file is a single neuron from Convolutional neural network model and algorithms.
